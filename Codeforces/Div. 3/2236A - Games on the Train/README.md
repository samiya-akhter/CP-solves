Dabir, Egor, and Arseniy just got on the train and decided to play a game. Dabir has a backpack with an infinite number of cubes. He built n towers from them, where the i-th tower has height h_i cubes.

Egor and Arseniy must choose an integer x_i for each tower i and increase its height by x_i **exactly once**. For example, if h = [1, 3, 2, 2], x = [3, 2, 2, 8], then after increasing h it will become [4, 5, 4, 10]. Their goal is to make the heights of all towers equal.

To make the game more interesting, Dabir wants to choose an integer k and add a restriction: each x_i must satisfy 1 ≤ x_i ≤ k. Help him find the smallest k for which it is possible to finish the game.

## Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5).

The second line contains n integers h_1, h_2, …, h_n (1 ≤ h_i ≤ 6).

## Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum value of k such that it is possible to make all towers have equal height.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
4
2
1 3
3
2 6 4
5
5 4 6 6 1
4
3 3 3 3
```

**Output:**

```
3
5
6
1
```
